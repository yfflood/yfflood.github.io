I am a PhD student at the department of industrial engineering, Tsinghua University. Currently, I'm visiting [Huiwen Jia's lab](https://huiwen-j.github.io/) at UC Berkeley. I received my B.E. in industrial engineering from Tsinghua University in 2023.

I study decision-making with an ambition to connect normative theories with descriptive behavioral models. Current investigations include:
- **Resource-Rational Analysis** of human cognition, with emphasis on behavioral decision making
- **Expert Elicitation Methodologies​​**, particularly indirect approaches for robust knowledge extraction and aggregation
