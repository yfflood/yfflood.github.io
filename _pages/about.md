I am a PhD student at the department of industrial engineering, Tsinghua University. I received my B.S. in industrial engineering from Tsinghua University in 2023.

My research is mainly focuesed on decision-making, with an interest in both normative theories and descriptive models. I'm also enthusiastic about algorithmic music composition (AIGC, etc.).
