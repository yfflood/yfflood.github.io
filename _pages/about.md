I am a PhD student at the department of industrial engineering, Tsinghua University. Currently, I'm visiting [Huiwen Jia's lab](https://huiwen-j.github.io/) at UC Berkeley. I received my B.E. in industrial engineering from Tsinghua University in 2023.

I study decision-making with an ambition to connect normative theories with descriptive models. Current investigations include:
- **Sequential Decision Algorithms** for efficient learning and decision-making 
- **Resource-Rational Analysis** of human decision making under risk and uncertainty
- **Expert Elicitation Methodologies​​** for robust knowledge extraction and aggregation
